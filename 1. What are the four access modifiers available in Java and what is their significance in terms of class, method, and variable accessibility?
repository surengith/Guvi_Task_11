1. What are the four access modifiers available in Java and what is their significance in terms of class, method, and variable accessibility?

Public:

Class: If a class is declared as public, it can be accessed from any other class.
Method: A public method can be called from any other class.
Variable: A public variable can be accessed from any other class.
Protected:

Class: A protected class is accessible within its package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
Method: A protected method is accessible within its package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
Variable: A protected variable is accessible within its package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
Default (Package-Private):

Class: If no access modifier is specified (default), it is visible only within its package.
Method: A method with default access is visible only within its package.
Variable: A variable with default access is visible only within its package.
Private:

Class: A private class is only accessible within the same class.
Method: A private method is only accessible within the same class.
Variable: A private variable is only accessible within the same class.
Significance:

Public: Use when you want the widest possible access. It is commonly used for classes and methods that are part of a library or API.

Protected: Useful when you want to allow subclasses to access certain members while keeping them hidden from the rest of the application.

Default (Package-Private): This is a good choice when you want to hide the class or method from classes outside of the package. It restricts access to the package.

Private: Use for members that should only be accessed within the defining class. This provides the highest level of encapsulation.
