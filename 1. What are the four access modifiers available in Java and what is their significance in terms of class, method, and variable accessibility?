1. What are the four access modifiers available in Java and what is their significance in terms of class, method, and variable accessibility?

Public:

Class: It can be accessed from any other class.
Method: Method can be called from any other class.
Variable: Variable can be accessed from any other class.


Protected:

Class: Class is accessible within its package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
Method: Method is accessible within its package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
Variable: Variable is accessible within its package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).


Default (Package-Private):

Class: It is visible only within its package.
Method: It is visible only within its package.
Variable: It is visible only within its package.


Private:

Class: Class is only accessible within the same class.
Method: Method is only accessible within the same class.
Variable: Variable is only accessible within the same class.


Significance:
Public: It is commonly used for classes and methods that are part of a library or API.
Protected: When you want to allow subclasses to access while keeping hidden from the rest of the application.
Default: When you want to hide the class or method from classes outside of the package.
Private: Only be accessed within the defining class. This provides the highest level of encapsulation.
