3. What is the difference between checked Exception and unchecked Exception?

Checked exceptions occur during compile time when the source code is being converted into an executable code.
Checked exceptions can be manually created. The Java Virtual Machine requires the checked exception to be caught or handled.

Unchecked exceptions occur during runtime when the program is in execution. The compiler does not check these types of exceptions.
Unchecked exceptions can also be manually created. The Java Virtual Machine does not require the unchecked exception to be caught or handled.
