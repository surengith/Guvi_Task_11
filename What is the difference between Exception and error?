What is the difference between Exception and error?

The difference between Exception and error is that:
An Exception is an event that occurs during the program execution and disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s execution. 
An Error is a severe situation generated when the user performs an unexpected operation.

Errors mostly happen at compile-time like syntax error; however it can happen at runtime as well. Whereas an Exception occurs at runtime 
(checked exceptions can be detected at compile time). Both Error and Exception have the same parent class as Throwable.

Handling:
Exception: Exceptions can be caught using try-catch blocks, allowing the program to handle the exceptional condition.
Error: Errors are not typically caught or handled by the program because they are severe problems.

Examples:
Exception: Examples of exceptions include NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, RuntimeException, ArithmeticException and FileNotFoundException.
Error: cinclude OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, and VirtualMachineError.
